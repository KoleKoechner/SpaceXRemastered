# Our Mission Statement
Space X will soon launch project Starship in an attempt to begin colonizing Mars and explore our knowledge of Sol (Our Solar System).

This site will act as a resource of information as it becomes available, not just from Space X but from other credible sources as well. Only accurate information will be listed here with all of our resources available for accurate verification.

# Changelog




[Doc notes & comments below]: # (DO NOT DELETE THIS! Anything below this is meant to be a place to keep comments and notation.
--Use the area below to add notes so that other team players can understand what is going on at all times.
--We can also use this as instructions to help guild a team member or the entire time. We'd do this by a 'To Do'. Example: For everyone/anyone 'Team - To Do' or to target a person 'Kole - To Do' or 'Evan - To Do' etc etc.
--How you notate in md is; open and closing brackets, colon, space, hash, space, parenthesis and within the parenthesis is where you put your message. End each note with a timestamp.)

[Assisting Memebers]: # (Under the assisting members section is where contributors will be listed. Anyone who helps with this project. Also add a hyperlink to their github {or other profile}. An example of how this is done is demonstrated above. 6/19/2020)

[Changelog]: # (This will not need to be populated yet and will only contain details that a user/visitor to your site would be concerned with; not backend things. This can be stuff like 'improved load times', 'added <insert feature here>', 'revamped the UI to be streamlined' etc etc. Do not concern yourself with this just yet. Once the site is finished, deployed and sustaining a following, that's when changelog can begin to be populated. 6/19/2020)

[Kole - To Do]: # (Read over the changes made. I think I've got a pretty good guideline established to give you a sense of direction. Fire up live-server to review these changes.
--Play around with the CSS to get the desired look/beauty you want. MIND THE CLASS AND ID DIFFERENCES CLOSELY/CAREFULLY. These changes were made based on the one wire-frame you added.
--In the 'oursystem.html' note the <img> tag has a height value. Play around with that height value so you'll have a better idea what size photos your site will render. What you choose will be the site standard! So be mindful of how large your images are {memory and resolution} for the sake of render times, how resizing the page makes everything respond etc etc. aka, this is the part where you try to break and make the site hiccup as if you were a random user visiting.
--Also note how the background plays with everything else. You may need to choose a different background or enact coding to get the floating effect like you did for your school project.
We can look at this together tonight or Friday night if you'd like. When you've completed this To-Do, delete it. 6/25/2020 19:51)

[Kole - To Do]: # (Focus on getting your wire-frames completed THEN move on to making additional pages. Not having a wire-frame is like trying to build a machine without blueprints and schematics; it is very important! You need a wire-frame for the 'home' page and 'about' page. Once that's complete then we can move on to making more page views. Also, mind your spelling. When you've completed this To-Do, delete it, all of line 38. 7/3/2020 01:22)
